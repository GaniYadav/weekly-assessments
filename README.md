 1.What is the difference between STLC(Software Testing Life Cycle) and SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)?

Ans. SDLC :
          *SDLC(Software development life cycle) is a step by step process used by software industry to design,develop and test the software
          * SDLC is mainly related to software development.
          * SDLC involves total five phases.There are Requirements analysis,Design,Development,Testing,and Maintenance.
          * In SDLC, more number of members (developers) are required for the whole process.
          * SDLC phases are completed before the STLC phases.
          * Post deployment support , enhancement , and update are to be included if necessary.
          * Creation of reusable software systems is the end result of SDLC.
          * Besides development other phases like testing is also included.
   STLC :
          * STLC is mainly related to software testing.
          * It focuses only on testing the software.
          * STLC involves total six phases.There are Requirement analysis,Test planning,Test desing,Test execution,Bug reporting,and Test closure.
          * In STLC, less number of members (testers) are needed.
          * STLC phases are performed after SDLC phases.
          * Regression tests are run by QA team to check deployed maintenance code and maintains test cases and automated scripts.
          * A tested software system is the end result of STLC.


2.What are verification and validation?

Ans. Verification is the process for determining whether or not a product fulfills the requirements or specifications established for it,and
        Validation is the assessment of a planned or delivered system to meet the sponsor's operational need in the most realistic environment achievable.

3.What is authorization and authentication?

Ans. Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

4.What is test management review and why it is important?

Ans. Test Management is a process where testing activities are managed to ensures high quality and high end testing of software application. 
       This method consists of tracking, organization, controlling process,checks visibility of the testing process in order to deliver the high quality software              application. 

5. Define client side and server side validation?
Ans. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation,and
      while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.

6. Explain the request response flow from front end to back end?
Ans. The frontend flow :
       The frontend is responsible to determine a solution for a given problem or opportunity and transform it into a RTL circuit description. 
   The backend process: 
       The backend is responsible for the physical implementation of a circuit. It transforms the RTL circuit description into a physical design, composed by gates and        its interconnections.The main phases of the backend process are Synthesis and Place&Route.

7. Explain life cycle phases of the project?
Ans.project is a software application is developed for specific customer based on the client requirement is known as project.
        There are 5 phases to the project life cycle (also called the 5 process groups)
    * Initiating phase :
		         I consists of just two separate processes, The project charter and stakeholder register. The point of this phase is to determine the vision for your                       project, document what you hope to accomplish,and secure approvals from a sanctioning stakeholder.
    * Planning phase:
		         Where you build the project infrastructure that will enable you to achieve your goal within your predetermined time and budget constraints, starting with              a project management plan, project scope, work breakdown structure and more
    *Executing phase:
		         Where most of the budget is allocated and most of the project deliverables are produced. You take your project plan and put it into action, whether that                 takes weeks, months, or even years.the goal of this phase as, “managing teams effectively while orchestrating timeline expectations and reaching                       benchmark goals.” The executing phase often includes team development, stakeholder engagement, and quality assurance activities, either on a formal or                 informal basis.
   * Monitoring and controlling phase: 
		        The involves keeping an eye on the actual progress of the project against your plan and taking corrective action where necessary. No amount of perfect                  planning will exempt you from the need to be constantly vigilant with tracking and reporting.
   * Closing phase:
		         Closing is the final phase of the project life cycle includes just one solitary process, and it’s more than simply checking off the project as done. It’s                essential to formally close the project and secure a sign-off or approval from the customer, stakeholders, and/or project sponsor. 

8. How do you define success?
Ans.Success is not permanent and failure is not final so never keep trying working after success and never keep trying after failure.

9.What are your strengths and weakness?
Ans. My strengths are self motivated,Honesty,hard working,time-management and Self-controlling
   & My weakness are Too emotinal & Too direct.

10.Have you faced any challenging situation and how did you overcome it?
Ans. In our final year,a team of 4 members were to give a presentation on sport event management system in a conference.However one of our team mates unfortunately got his leg fractured.As we have picked up a specific topic to speak individually, the sudden addition of content had put a lot of pressure on us because it has taken us months to prepare.But we don't want to miss this opportunity.So i have taken up the extra responsibility of filling his topic too.Thanks to my team's efforts,our team managed to successfully complete the presentation and also was awarded for our best performance.
